2020 i started running TrueNAS on a old desktop-pc. Due to space and ventilation
problems, i decided to upgrade my NAS.

# Software

## Starting Point

I really like TrueNAS Core because of its stability and ease of use. It makes data
handling a joy and i love the perfectly integrated ZFS. That's why TrueNAS had to stay
somehow...

My first setup with the old desktop-pc was limited to FreeBSD and its jails,
because of the CPU. The CPU wasn't able to virtualize another OS on top of TrueNAS.
This is why i get used to the FreeBSD Jails, which is fine, but i also want to run
Linux OS's.

## Proxmox, TrueNAS Core or TrueNAS Scale?

There were different possibilities, which would fit my needs:

### TrueNAS Core
I could just stick with plain TrueNAS Core as i was used to and virtualize some VM's
on this. I read and was getting convinced, that TrueNAS Core is built as a NAS solution
and the Virtualization is not as user-friendly as it could be.

### TrueNAS Scale
TrueNAS Scale is available for testing for quite some time now. For homelabs it is
probably stable enough right now. It is also based on a simple Debian, which i like,
but i read that many features are still buggy.

### Proxmox
Proxmox is a pure Hypervisor which would certainly fit my needs in this aspect, but
what about my Storage needs...

## The combination
Inspired by some other blogs i decided to go with the combination of Proxmox and
TrueNAS Core. Proxmox as the host system, and TrueNAS as a VM with passed through
SATA-Controllers. I admit it is a complex system, which comes with drawbacks
(especially an extra layer, which can fail...)., but i also don't like to have too
much hardware, which isn't necessary.

The setup was straight forward thanks to the nice documentation of proxmox. The
hardware-passthrough takes some time to get configured, but once it is done it runs
fine (see documentation and wiki[^1]).

One has some possibilities on what filesystem to install proxmox like ext4, xfs, btrfs
or zfs. Because of my good experiences with zfs in TrueNAS I chose zfs. Proxmox sets
automatically a cronjob to scrub the setup pool.

    root@pve:~# cat /etc/cron.d/zfsutils-linux
    PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

    # TRIM the first Sunday of every month.
    24 0 1-7 * * root if [ $(date +\%w) -eq 0 ] && [ -x /usr/lib/zfs-linux/trim ];
    then /usr/lib/zfs-linux/trim; fi

    # Scrub the second Sunday of every month.
    24 0 8-14 * * root if [ $(date +\%w) -eq 0 ] && [ -x /usr/lib/zfs-linux/scrub ];
    then /usr/lib/zfs-linux/scrub; fi


## Things i don't like in Proxmox
* It is a little inconvenient to set it up with no subscription. You need to adjust
repositories and every time you login, there is a warning, that you do not use
a subscription...
* There are no temperatures like in TrueNAS in the Proxmox dashboards and the WebUI
in general is less nice.

# Hardware
I only used consumer grade hardware. Here a list:
* Mainboard: MSI Pro Z690-P D4
* CPU: Intel Core i7-12700K
* Case: Fractal Define R5 Black
* Main-Disks: WD Blue SN550 2TB (in ZFS mirror)
* Memory: 4x Transcend DDR4 LONG-DIMM, 2Rx8, 32 GB
* Big Pool: 3x Seagate Exos X18 18 TB, 3.5", CMR (in RAIDz1)
* other disks in different configurations...

## Before
Clearly a little mess. During disassembling some drives were too hot to touch...

## After
That's more like it. Tidy and guaranteed airflow, also for the hard-drives. Additionally,
upgrading the hardware in this case is fun, whereas in the previous case it was always
a fight accompanied by scratches.
